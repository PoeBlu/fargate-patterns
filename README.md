# Fargate Design Patterns

## Compendium and Code Examples of AWS Fargate Patterns.

**AWS Fargate** is the Uber of container service allowing engineers to hail a container by specifying their compute and memory needs. By providing an incredible on-demand flexibility and removing the burden of resource provisioning just as Lambda did years ago to servers, Fargate is disrupting the container management technology.


## What is AWS Fargate?
Making software behave predictably in different environments where it is deployed during the lifecycle of an application is one of the biggest challenges of development. Unexpected behaviors due to even subtle differences in system s Containers were invented to solve this problem

Put simply, **AWS Fargate** is a managed, compute engine provided by AWS to run your containers without having to worry about managing a cluster of servers. You don't have to choose server types, upgrade or patch servers or optimize container packing on your clusters. 

This is analogous to hailing a Uber. With Uber you just tell what size car you want based on how many people are riding, if you want a car seat or want the car to be wheel-chair accessible. You donâ€™t specify a Lexus or a Toyota. With Fargate, all you do is package your application in containers, specify the CPU and memory requirements, define networking and IAM policies, and launch the application. Fargate takes care of scaling so that you don't have to worry about provisioning enough compute resources for your containers to scale out. 

If you are used to traditional container management, you will really appreciate Fargate allowing you to focus on the 'Dev' part of designing and building your applications and removing the 'Ops' part of managing infrastructure from your 'DevOps' responsibilities. 

## Focus of this workshop

In this workshop, we will explore three design patterns viz., the ***Container-on-Demand***, ***Scaling-Container*** and ***Sidecar-Assembly*** patterns that allows Fargate to be used just like Lambdas for heavy on-demand tasks where Lambda is not suitable, or run containers traditionally but without having to manage infrastructure.

We will use the *Container-on-Demand* pattern to build an on-demand video thumbnail service  on-demand task to generate thumbnail images from video files. With this pattern you can spin the containers on demand and immediately decommission after the task is run.

We will use the *Scaling-Container* to build the an auto-scaling service that finds the value of the coins thrown on a table from an image. With this pattern you will have a small footprint always running and scale up or down as the processing demands.

Later we will explore the *Sidecar-Assembly* pattern to assemble otherwise fully functional services running in containers to build an application that has expanded capabilities beyond what is provided by these services. In essence, to reinforce that the whole is greater than sum of its parts.
